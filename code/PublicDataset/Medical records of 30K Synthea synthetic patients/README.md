Version 1.0
`Chen, AJ, 2022, "Medical records of 30K Synthea synthetic patients", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BWDKXS, Harvard Dataverse, V1`

## Description 
The dataset has 2 populations of Synthea synthetic patients generated by Synthea tool. Each population has 15K patients with original medical records in CSV files. Because the total file size is >3GB in each population, the files are compressed in zip file. Synthea records are in domains similar to those in real EMR, including patients, encounters, conditions (diagnosis), observations, medications, and procedures. The data was first used in building ML models for lung cancer risk prediction. For more information, see the published paper in Nature Scientific Reports (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23011-4)
